## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for Lab 4. Answer the follwing questions by writing R code. 

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


**Problem 1:** (3+3+3+3 = 12 points) Suppose a computer systems number of failures follow a cumulative probability function cdf with the values \
x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\
P(X<=x)=0.17 0.44 0.69 0.86 0.94 0.98 0.99\
(a) Graph the cdf using plot with the option: type = "s"
(b) Use the cdf to find P(3 <= X <= 5).
(c) Find the pdf p(x) = P(X = x) using p(x) = F(x) - F(x-1).
(d) Plot the pdf using plot with the option: type = "h".

```{r}
# R Code to Problem 1 below
# a.
n <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
p = c(0.17, 0.44, 0.69, 0.86, 0.94, 0.98, 0.99)
?dbinom()
x <- pgeom(n,p)
plot(x, type = "s")
# b. 
print(pgeom(5,0.94)-pgeom(3,0.69))
# c. 

j <- pgeom(n,p) - pgeom(n-1,p)
print(j)
       
# k <- ecdf(j)



```


**Problem 2:** (3+3+3+3 = 12 points) A new user of an new app received an average of 4 messages per day. If it can be assumed that the arrival pattern of these messages is Poisson, calculate the following probabilities
(a) Exactly three messages will be received in one day: P(X = 3).
(a) More than three messages will be received in one day: P(X > 3).
(c) A day will pass without a message.
(d) If a day passes without a message, six messages will arrive the next day.

```{r}
# R Code to Problem 2 below

```

**Problem 3:** (3+3 = 6 points) A new user app will runs on phones for an average of 3.4 hours a day with a variance of 1.2 hours. Assume that the active time is normally distributed. Find the probabilities that
(a) The app wil run for 4 hour or more.
(b) The app will run between 2 and 4.5 hours.
